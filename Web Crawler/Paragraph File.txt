students to develop the depth of their knowledge in a particular subject putting them on the right course to become leaders in their fieldsthe answer to the question of what is an msc in mathematics lies in understanding how different types of math are categorized instead of focusing on a particular type of math such as algebra or calculus a postgraduate degree in general mathematics allows students to concentrate on number theory and advanced mathematical methods that tie together all the different forms of mathematics they have likely already learned this degree tends to have a heavy focus on analysis and theory rather than practical uses of math but most schools also require several application courses for completionan msc in mathematics gives students who want to work in science engineering or computing a solid core education most degree programs also require a research component so students can get a feel for how to use their new skills in the real worldthe cost of a masters

a master s degree is a postgraduate degree for students who want to become more skilled or specialized in a particular discipline while bachelor s and other undergraduate degrees typically give a relatively broad overview of a particular area of study master s degrees tend to be more focused and allow students to develop the depth of their knowledge in a particular subject putting them on the right course to become leaders in their fieldsthe answer to the question of what is an msc in mathematics lies in understanding how different types of math are categorized instead of focusing on a particular type of math such as algebra or calculus a postgraduate degree in general mathematics allows students to concentrate on number theory and advanced mathematical methods that tie together all the different forms of mathematics they have likely already learned this degree tends to have a heavy focus on analysis and theory rather than practical uses of math but most schools also require several application courses for completionan msc in mathematics gives students who want to work in science engineering or computing a solid core education most degree programs also require a research component so students can get a feel for how to use their new skills in the real worldthe cost of a masters in mathematics depends on what institution you choose to study at most degree programs take one to two years to complete so the cost of tuition should be assessed accordinglymany careers in science engineering technology and computers are accessible with a master of mathematics in addition a postgraduate degree in math makes job seekers more attractive to hiring managers in the fields of business and finance who look for the kind of problem solving and analytical skills that are taught in advanced math coursescompleting an msc in mathematics online is a great way for people who can t attend class in person to get a higher education search for your program below and contact directly the admission office of the school of your choice by filling in the lead form the msc in applied mathematics works with the connection between mathematical theory and reallife problems our courses include

applied mathematics is concerned with the development and application of mathematical tools for the analysis and design of dynamical systems that appear in modern technology mathematical modeling of the problems appearing there plays a basic role followed by numerical analysis computer simulation and design of controllers to make the systems behave according to the desired specifications interaction with other disciplines and with specialists in the fields of application is essentialduring your 2year masters program you will be embedded in one of the applied mathematics research groups of your choice your research project will be supervised by staff members the research project can be taken in the form of an internship in the research division of a company as well the masters degree program in applied mathematics offers two trackssystems and controlthis track is concerned with the analysis design and optimization of complex dynamical systems in particular it deals with the mathematical tools behind large scale networks like electric power networks water distribution networks the internet platoons of cars formations of robots and networks of systems in general a central issue is the design and synthesis of controllers and protocols to make these networks behave in an optimal way the specialization systems and control deals with mathematical systems and control theory and the emphasis of this specialization are on the mathematics behind various technological applications rather than on the applications themselvescomputational mathematicsthe computational sciences have revolutionized the process of scientific discovery by adding a new mode to it the virtual laboratory often complementary to theoretical observational or experimental means the mathematical contributions to this research methodology are twofold  a computational model of the phenomenon of interest needs to be constructed and secondly algorithms for solving the governing equations are to be developed the master track computational mathematics focuses on both mathematical aspects computational modeling and numerical algorithms the main application area is fluid dynamics computational fluid dynamics cfd has a rich tradition in the netherlands which has led to a strong chain from basic research to application2year program credits per year 60 ects most courses are 5 ects in your

the primary mission of the ms degree program in mathematics and statistics is to prepare students for professional careers in disciplines which make use of the mathematical and statistical sciences the curriculum is intended for individuals who have strong backgrounds but not necessarily baccalaureate degrees in mathematics it is the only such program in the greater dc area and it culminates in an ms degree in mathematics and statisticsthe program derives its philosophy from government and industry organizations in the dc area and has placed graduates into government agencies defense and financial firms and nonprofits there is a steady demand for highly trained professionals in data analytics applied mathematical and statistical modeling and cloud computing and our students have proven to be exceptionally competitive in the job market a thriving internship program in mathematical and statistical consulting helps to train and place students and graduates into exciting jobs and satisfying careersthe degree requires 10 graduate courses and is built around a core of four applied mathematics and statistics courses consisting of probability applied mathematics mathematical statistics and numerical mathematics the curriculum is filled out with mathstat electives and every student is also encouraged to take a nonmathstat elective as well mathstat electives include computational science matlab sas r and cloud introduction regression analysis stochastic processes financial mathematics time series data mining bayesian statistics linear programming machine learning data analytics mathematics of climate sparse sampling and representation social network analysis survey sampling and cloud computing some examples of nonmathstat electives are biostatistics computer science econometrics public policy surveys and computational neurosciencefrom this rich and diverse curriculum our students emerge with key practical skills in areas of national priority in addition to the careerenabling aspects of the degree our students also develop a love and appreciation for the beauty and excitement of the world of applied mathematics and statisticsthe program is open to both full time and part time students the latter of whom are typically working professionals in the dc area who may take advantage of our evening classes to obtain relevant and uptodate training about 3040 of students in the program are working professionals these valued colleagues add diversity and seasoning to the student body as well as key connections to the dc area workforce the program actively facilitates robust networking within the program for all students and facultyfulltime students can expect to complete the program in three semesters plus one summer parttime students may take as many courses per semester within reason as their work and personal obligations permit there are successful alumni who have finished in two years as parttimers and others who have elected to take 10 consecutive semesters including summers to complete the 10 courses flexible graduate school rules allow this wide choice of options however unnecessary delays in completing the degree are not in the best interests of the students or the program and so the nominal course load is required to be three completed courses per calendar year consecutively and including summersthe program enrolled its first class in the fall semester of 2006 and has grown to a stable and continuing size of about 100 students each fall semester we enroll roughly 3035 new students and there is an admission window for spring semesters as well with an average of about 57 new studentsseveral courses but not all in the curriculum are now using lecture capture technology whereby registered students may participate live audiovideochat in classes from offsite using the zoom teleconferencing software the mp4 files of zoom classes are also archived so that the class audiovideo may be web streamed for class review by registered students this option is part of the university instructional continuity program and is intended as a substitute for regular class attendance during emergency campus closings information on

more applied and practical curriculum some traditional topics such as algebra topology abstract real and complex analysis and measure theorybased probability are not part of the curriculum there are options in the form of tutorials and directed studies for students who have the need for such courses a limited number of graduate courses can be transferred from other institutions with the primary criterion being that such courses cannot have counted towards a previous degree courses can also be taken through the dc consortium of universities wwwconsortiumorg transfer and consortium courses are subject to accumulated credit caps and approval by the program consortium courses are not especially encouraged because the quality of instruction in mathstat at georgetown is of dependable and exceptional quality but can be approved with justificationprerequisites for applyingto enter the program students need to have at a minimum the equivalent of a mathematics minor which for our purposes means three semesters of calculus culminating in multivariable calculus plus linear algebra other courses in mathematics and statistics will strengthen an application the minimum grade point average for admission is 30 b average students who do not satisfy all of the prerequisites but have a strong academic record in a field that draws significantly from mathematics and statistics eg economics engineering biology computational social sciences may consider taking the prerequisite courses at their local area colleges and then applying applications from prospective students who are in the process of taking the last such prerequisite classes will be accepted and evaluated it is important to understand that satisfying the prerequisites does not alone guarantee admission admission is competitive and is the result of a number of factors including academic record letters of recommendation breadth and depth of academic background and experience and strength of academic institutions attendedscholarships and internshipstuition at georgetown is charged on a per credit basis the rate is the same independent of the number of courses taken students must be enrolled in at least

program has a modest and highly competitive meritbased tuitionwaiver scholarship program the largest scholarships provide tuition waivers for one course for the first semester and potentially renewable in any subsequent semester fulltime students have the highest priority as parttime students are working and earning income as a general rule whereas most fulltime students do not have earned income transfer or consortium courses see other options above will be treated as tuitionwaived courses the scholarship program can support fewer than 10 of students any applicant international or otherwise may apply for scholarship consideration by checking the appropriate box on the electronic applicationfulltime students are typically interested in finding internships in the summer after their first two semesters although internship positions can never be guaranteed the program has been successful in placing students it is important to keep in mind that internships are competitive and that good grades and strong resumes are factors in obtaining positions a common paradigm is for fulltime students to obtain internships in the summer after the first year although internships in the regular semesters are also possible and to continue the position into the fall of the second year in some cases the students then become parttime in the second year as they continue taking classes internships can potentially convert to opportunities for fulltime employment it is important to note that internships with the federal government and most of its contractors require us citizenshipinternational students are strongly encouraged to apply by february 15 or even earlier because of the additional time required to arrange for immigration papers for admitted students for international students who apply after february 15 we will try to evaluate applications in a timely way but cannot guarantee that we can complete reviews quickly enough to make admission offers by the middle of aprilaround the first week of may the academic year closes and the admissions committee ceases its work for the cycle applications that are not complete and ready for review by may 1 may be declined simply because the committee cannot arrange to review them recommenders can be notoriously tardy in submitting letters it is therefore advisable to not risk having missing letters or other

stockholder voting power through supervoting stock they incorporated google as a california privately held company on september 4 1998 in california google was then reincorporated in delaware on october 22 200212 an initial public offering ipo took place on august 19 2004 and google moved to its headquarters in mountain view california nicknamed the  googleplex in august 2015 google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called alphabet inc google is alphabets leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for alphabets internet interests sundar pichai was appointed ceo of google replacing larry page who became the ceo of alphabetthe companys rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products acquisitions and partnerships beyond googles core search engine google search it offers services designed for work and productivity google docs google sheets and google slides email gmail scheduling and time management google calendar cloud storage google drive instant messaging and video chat duo hangouts chat and meet language translation google translate mapping and navigation google maps waze google earth and street view podcast hosting google podcasts video sharing youtube blog publishing blogger notetaking google keep and google jamboard and photo organizing and editing google photos the company leads the development of the android mobile operating system the google chrome web browser and chrome os a lightweight operating system based on the chrome browser google has moved increasingly into hardware from 2010 to 2015 it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its nexus devices and it released multiple hardware products in october 2016 including the google pixel line of smartphones google home smart speaker google wifi mesh wireless router and google daydream virtual reality headset google has also experimented with becoming an internet carrier google fiber google fi and google station13googlecom is the most visited website worldwide several other googleowned websites also are on the list of most popular websites including youtube and blogger14google was the most valuable brand in the world in 2017 surpassed by amazon15 but has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns tax avoidance antitrust censorship and search neutralitygoogle began in january 1996 as a research project by larry page and sergey brin when they were both phd students at stanford university in stanford california16 the project initially involved an unofficial third founder scott hassan the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original google search engine but he left before google was officially founded as a company1718 hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company willow garage in 20061920while conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites21 they called this algorithm pagerank it determined a websites relevance by the number of pages and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site2223 page told his ideas to hassan who began writing the code to implement pages ideas17page and brin originally nicknamed the new search engine backrub because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site242526 hassan as well as alan steremberg were cited by page and brin as being critical to the development of google rajeev motwani and terry winograd later coauthored with page and brin the first paper about the project describing pagerank and the initial prototype of the google search engine published in 1998 h ctor garc amolina and jeff ullman were also cited as contributors to the project27 pagerank was influenced by a similar pageranking and sitescoring algorithm earlier used for rankdex developed by robin li in 1996 with larry pages pagerank patent including a citation to lis earlier rankdex patent li later went on to create the chinese search engine baidu282930eventually they changed the name to google the name of the search engine originated from a misspelling of the word googol3132 the number 1 followed by 100 zeros which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information33the domain name wwwgooglecom was registered on september 15 199735 and the company was incorporated on september 4 1998 it was based in the garage of a friend susan wojcicki16 in menlo park california craig silverstein a fellow phd student at stanford was hired as the first employee163637google was initially funded by an august 1998 contribution of 100000 from andy bechtolsheim cofounder of sun microsystems the money was given before google was incorporated38 google received money from three other angel investors in 1998 amazoncom founder jeff bezos stanford university computer science professor david cheriton and entrepreneur ram shriram39 between these initial investors friends and family google raised around 1 million dollars which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in menlo park california40after some additional small investments through the end of 1998 to early 199939 a new 25 million round of funding was announced on june 7 199941 with major investors including the venture capital firms kleiner perkins and sequoia capital38in march 1999 the company moved its offices to palo alto california42 which is home to several prominent silicon valley technology startups43 the next year google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against page and brins initial opposition toward an advertisingfunded search engine4416 to maintain an uncluttered page design advertisements were solely textbased45 in june 2000 it was announced that google would become the default search engine provider for yahoo one of the most popular websites at the time replacing inktomi4647in 2003 after outgrowing two other locations the company leased an office complex from silicon graphics at 1600 amphitheatre parkway in mountain view california49 the complex became known as the googleplex a play on the word googolplex the number one followed by a googol zeroes three years later google bought the property from sgi for 319 million50 by that time the name google had found its way into everyday language causing the verb google to be added to the

postcoronavirus football industrychanged routinesfootball evolves slowly but fans players and stakeholders alike have adjusted very quickly to patterns beyond that to which they are accustomed as normality returns it is likely to do so in unpredictable and unprecedented ways particularly involving fans return to the stands clubs will need to negotiate the unknown keeping everybody safe and informed as regular habits are disruptedin other aspects of the business change will be put on hold many clubs have been working to diversify their fanbase over recent years but will divert some of that energy back to reconnecting with seasonticket holders and loyal supportersmatchday innovation whilst the full financial impact of covid19 is yet to be felt  reported deloitte ahead of the 202021 season  it is anticipated that the clubs in smaller footballing countries and those in the lower leagues of larger countries will be hit the hardest these clubs typically have a greater dependency on matchday revenues with nobody coming through the turnstiles clubs are innovating ways to create revenue on matchdays for example top danish club fc midtjylland turned their stadium car park into a drivein to watch games on the big screen but even when the gates are fully open again clubs could struggle to attract crowds due to nervousness around using public transport and fans may require encouragement to hang around and spend their money in stadium shops and bars after gamesyouth players thriveone unexpected advantage of a  recession  in the football business is that managers can no longer rely on big bank reserves to finance squad improvements they will have to get inventive to bolster their team instead of investing tens of millions in headlinegrabbing signings managers and coaches will invest unprecedented time and care in their youth squads therefore promoting local talentat ipswich we have a really talented group from under15s and under16s upwards says paul lambert manager at ipswich town  i know that if we can t go out and spend a certain amount we can bring these guys in and develop them developing technology   and relationshipsthe digitalized aspects of football are likely to go into rapid flux as a result of covid lockdowns clubs and broadcasters will lean on technological solutions to deliver new types of content and diversify revenue sources sponsors will require more meaningful relationships with clubs and supporters to ensure they are getting their money s worth again this is likely to involve digital solutions as big data and club websites are put to work personalizing fans experience and advertising profilesfinancial hit not as bad as predictedthe good news is financial losses have not been as bad as forecast  a kpmg study suggested that the big five leagues were likely to lose up to  4 billion in 201920 alone and that up to  10 billion could be wiped off the value of players  reports espn instead more recent forecasts estimate a total loss of  4 billion across 20 top leagues rather than five and two seasons rather than one since that  4bn is from a projected revenue of  451 billion it is clear that the issue is

welcome to the babbel press roomlinguists at yale university shed light on babbel learners  spanish speaking skillsafter three months participants  speaking abilities ranged between exchanging greetings and providing basic personal information to discussing activities and future plans in the new language95 found babbel to be a convenient way to learn a new language and 75 met their personal learning goalsbabbel the world s topgrossing language learning app today released the results of an academic study  measuring babbel s efficacy in developing oral proficiency 1 conducted in collaboration with linguists based at yale university the research project evaluated the effectiveness of babbel s pedagogical method recruiting english speakers in the us who learned spanish over the course of three months a relatively short period of study in view of the amount of time learners typically need to invest to achieve basic competency in a new language the results demonstrate that learning with babbel leads to conversational ability in a second language all learners developed some measure of oral proficiency with skills ranging from basics like exchanging greetings and providing personal information to more challenging topics like discussing activities and future plans in the new languagebabbel founder  ceo markus witte believes such research is essential for creating transparency regarding the outcomes learners can expect from using the app  no matter which method or tool you use to learn a new language the time you invest is incredibly valuable it s essential to know your time and effort are wellspent   said mr witte  the results of this study do exactly that corroborating the results of an earlier study which showed that using babbel facilitates the development of oral communication skills it s further proof of the effectiveness of babbel s teaching method  due to the lack of available research on language learning apps there is a fair degree of scepticism regarding their impact on learners  speaking abilities the results of our study however strongly suggest  that babbel can be an effective tool for learning basic conversation skills  says dr nelleke van deusenscholl the study s colead investigator and director of yale university s center for language study  statistical results confirmed a correlation between using babbel and effectiveness of learning spanish showing a progression in initial proficiency levels in line with current linguistics literature on speaking skill development it was shown that babbel can help learners get to a conversation in a new language for the study the research team recruited a diverse group of participants from all over the us who had no speaking ability in spanish prior to learning with babbel after following babbel s spanish courses over approximately three months 117 participants took the oral proficiency interviewcomputer version opic  a speaking test created by the american council on the teaching of foreign languages used to assess for example the language skills of prospective teachers of foreign languages all participants made some measurable gains in their oral proficiency in spanish these ranged between exchanging greetings and providing basic personal information to discussing activities and future plans in the new languagein addition to the results of the opic speaking test participants were surveyed regarding their overall learning experience with babbel 91 of surveyed participants reported they enjoyed learning spanish with babbel while 95 found that babbel made it convenient to learn a new language additionally most of the respondents 75 felt that they had met their goals learning with babbelthe study also contains insights regarding the profile and motivations of those seeking to learn a language later in life  mental fitness emerged as a compelling motivation for a significant percentage of the language learners in our study  said mary jo lubrano the study s other colead investigator and associate director of yale university s center for language study  while our study reached across a broad range of learners representing different age groups and varied motivations for learning over half were over the age of 55 this is a population that is rarely included in current research on language acquisition and the subject of growing

welcome to the babbel press roomnew findings show that less than 10 hours learning with babbel leads to measurable improvement in second language conversational abilitybabbel the world s topgrossing language learning app today released results of an academic study  learning spanish with babbel 1 conducted in collaboration with a research team at michigan state university msu the study evaluated the effectiveness of babbel s pedagogical method providing empirical evidence that learning with babbel leads to improved speaking ability in a second languageafter learning spanish with babbel over approximately 12 weeks nearly all participants who completed the study made statistically significant gains in oral proficiency grammar knowledge and  or vocabulary knowledge furthermore both true novices and more experienced spanish learners made gains via using the app on the whole learners in this study increased their oral proficiency as measured by an improvement on a wellestablished and valid speaking test the oral proficiency interview  commented dr shawn loewen the study s lead investigator and professor of second language studies at michigan state university  these results establish that using babbel can facilitate the development of oral communication skills and not just grammar and vocabulary acquisition as a previous study had demonstrated despite the fact that millions globally are already using language learning apps there is a lack of published research on their impact on speaking skills this robust and methodologically rigorous study therefore makes an important contribution to the field the study could provide a model for how language learning apps can work with applied linguists and second language acquisition experts to establish the efficacy of their pedagogical methodsthe approximately 12week study consisted of 85 msu undergraduate students 54 of whom completed all study procedures participants studied spanish on babbel as often as they liked and had free choice of which babbel spanish lessons and courses to access overall 59 of study participants measurably improved their oral proficiency 97 of study participants who logged a minimum of 10 hours with babbel saw better test scores on grammar and vocabulary tests and 73 became better speakers babbel s mission is to get learners speaking their new language right away and empirical studies like this provide transparency regarding our app s efficacy in doing exactly that  said babbel ceo us julie hansen  particularly telling are the meaningful development in functional communication skills  the ability to express something complex that learners weren t able to before we now have further proof that babbel s method allows for true conversational connection without a huge level of time invested for a indepth overview of how study participants  speaking ability and grammar and vocabulary skills  improved after using the app please see the white paper learning spanish with babbel oral proficiency outcomes in appbased foreign language learning1  loewen s isbell d  sporn z 2018 learning spanish with babbel oral proficiency outcomes in appbased foreign language learningbabbel   the app that helps you speak a new language like you ve always wanted to when learning a language nothing is more rewarding than a real conversation 73 of surveyed customers feel that they d be able to hold a conversation within five hours of using the appthe babbel language learning app for web ios and android makes it easy to learn 14 different languages from 8 display languages bitesized lessons fit into everyday life and are split into useful realworld topics from introducing oneself to ordering food and making travel arrangements the app s effective game mechanics ensure that learners stay motivated to achieve their goals with the average user continuing to learn with babbel for more than 12 months uniquely every course is created specifically for each language pair by a team of education experts linguists and language teachers fast company magazine recognised babbel as the most innovative education company of 2016babbel was founded in 2007 since then the team has grown to 750 people from more than 50 nations spread between berlin and new york with no ads and a transparent subscriptionbased business model the company s focus remains firmly on getting learners conversational fast in 2016 the company surpassed 1000000 active paying subscribersfor more information visit wwwbabbelcom

release milestonesissue 1 will link to perrelease entry points or else navigate issues via label or milestone within githubevery change to the site comes via discussions here substantive changes are recorded in our release notesa preview of the draft new release notes can be found as part of the test site for our next releaseevery month or so after final review by the schemaorg steering group and wider community we make a formal releaseregarding cc and opensource licenses for documents and software see our faq entrywe are always interested in practical suggestions for improvements to schemaorg and our collection of schemas has been growing gradually since our launch in 2011we try to prioritize simple fixes and improvements to our existing schemas examples and documentation over the addition of new vocabulary and we are most likely to add new schemas when there is evidence that some preferably largescale consuming application will make use of the data consuming applications need not be search engines software tools eg opensource markupenriched approaches to web analytics browser addons or cloud tools are all rich areas for exploration and collaboration the important thing is that there should be some reasonable expectation of data consumers making good use of the changes it is not sufficient to justify additions on the basis that search engines generally try to use schemaorgbased structured data smaller changes and backwardscompatible changes are easier to incorporatenote that schemaorg does not attempt to capture the full detail of web content it is necessarily a simplification of a more complex reality this means that there will be many cases where adding more detail to schemaorg will look possible however in the interests of keeping schemaorg simple and usable for publishers and webmasters we will often choose not to add such detail schemaorg uses web standards such as jsonld microdata and rdfa toallow for independent extension for example see gs1s vocabularywe are also highly unlikely to take on large scale reorganizations of schemaorgs terminology if they are motivated solely  by considerations of elegance proper modeling ontological purity or conceptual unification although the project founders and team are familiar with  and respectful of  the traditions behind such concerns the scale scope and nature of schemaorg has required us to trade elegance and global consistency for a somewhat scruffier notion of incremental evolution and a pragmatic tolerance for a style that would be out of place in a formal ontology proposals for unifying crossdomain logicbased knowledge structures may be better received eg in the ontolog communitywe sometimes introduce types without dedicated property associations simply for markup usability reasons in a formal ontology this is often considered poor modeling however logically equivalent structures can result in many more errors from publisherswebmasters unfamiliar with the underlying formal concepts behind jsonld or rdfs schemaorg is not a closed system and other initiatives eg wikidata or gs1 have defined many other terms that can be mixed in alongside those we define at schemaorg we also make efforts to align our designs to relevant external standards and initiatives even when it reduces the global elegance of schemaorg considered alone for example in a bibliographic or cultural heritage context we may be influenced by initiatives like marc bibframe and frbr while for ecommerce we collaborated with good relations and gs1 schemaorgs newsrelated terms were heavily influenced by incorporating iptcs rnews design alongside collaborations with fact checkers the trust project and others our tv and music related vocabularies are heavily influenced by working with the bbc and the european broadcasting union alongside the music ontology and musicbrainz our schemas reflect these prior designs we prefer to collaborate in this way improving schemaorg incrementally and working to polish integrate and blend such designs rather than produce our own pure model in isolation the result may lack global elegance but brings our work into alignment with related efforts worldwidewe always welcome issues that track usability and readability issues but encourage a focus on concrete situations eg how to describe repeating events rather than global philosophical concerns eg whether a reservation or action is really an event we prioritize local coherence having sensible ways to describe many common situations over global elegance having a global theory in which everything has a sensible place this doesnt mean we never have cleanups but they are balanced against and often outweighed by other considerationswhen we add terms often into the pending area we strongly encourage feedback that takes a global perspective how does a new term relate to others how could it be used alongside preexisting patterns etc the changes we make during this integration phase reflect such considerations but are usually expressed through modest rewording examples or adjustment to the documentation of typeproperty links rather than through major restructuringsee more on how we workfor most collaborators all you need to know about the software is how to run itthe objective of the software is to create a static copy of the schemaorg site including potential local changes to inspect and run behind a simple web server on a local system for testing  in the same way that a production release is deployed to a cloud server your local version could then be deployed to a virtual machine using gcloud to enable collaboration with othersfull instructions are available in softwarereadmemd explaining how to create the initial local copy to work with then evolve to test out any changesessentially you will need to have a linuxlike inc  mac environment loaded with python version 36 or above you can then make test builds of schemaorg running on your own machine accessible as httplocalhost8080 or else post them on appspotcom for collaboration see the appengine documentation for details of the relevant gcloud commandsmore detailed information about the software and is use is available in softwarereadmemdsee also notes in the wiki httpsgithubcomschemaorgschemaorgwikicontributingall schemas and examples are in data in utf8 encoded filesthe main schemas file is

on vaccine contracts collected by duke university unicef and airfinity a science analytics company the highincome countries have gotten to the front of the line and cleared the shelves  said andrea taylor a duke researcher who is studying the contractsthe united states has provided billions of dollars to back the research development and manufacturing of five of the most promising vaccines against covid19 pushing them forward at a speed and scale that would otherwise have been impossible but the support came with a condition that americans would get priority access to doses made in their countryother wealthy nations joined the united states in placing large preorders often with options to expand the deals and acquire even more   undermining many countries  ability to make timely purchasesthe united states has secured 100 million doses from pfizer with the option of buying 500 million more and 200 million from moderna with an additional 300 million on offer it has also preordered 810 million doses from astrazeneca johnson  johnson novavax and sanofi combined expansion deals could push that number to 15 billionbritain has claimed 357 million doses from all of those companies along with a small company valneva with options to buy 152 million morethe european union has secured 13 billion from most of the same companies as well as the german company curevac it can have another 660 million doses if it choosesnearly all of these vaccines have been developed as twodose treatments how quickly the wealthy countries will achieve full coverage is uncertain in large part because the candidates are in varied stages of progresspfizer s vaccine developed with biontech is now authorized in britain bahrain canada mexico saudi arabia and the united states moderna s is expected soon to follow astrazeneca working with the university of oxford is likely to seek approval in britain india and several other countries in the coming weeks armed with data from outside the united states where it has suffered setbacks with regulatorsvalneva has not yet entered clinical trials sanofi working with glaxosmithkline recently changed its approval timetable to the end of next year after clinical results showed a poor performance in older peoplebut the outlook for most of the developing world is dire because of manufacturing limits it could take until 2024 for many lowincome countries to obtain enough vaccines to fully immunize their populationsnot all of the less wealthy nations will face severe shortages some have secured a substantial number of doses that could come on the market next year by leveraging their own drugmanufacturing strengthsindia is on track to produce more doses of coronavirus vaccines next year than any other country the serum institute of india which has contracts for large quantities of the astrazeneca and novavax vaccines has promised the indian government half of its output india gets priority because it s my home country  adar poonawalla the company s chief executive said in an interviewand the billionaire carlos slim has helped fund a deal for 150 million doses of the astrazeneca vaccine in latin america drawing on manufacturing capacities in argentina and his native mexicothe astrazeneca vaccine is well suited to poorer countries because it is inexpensive and easy to store far more doses of astrazeneca s vaccine have been promised than of any other candidate 321 billion over half of them committed to poor and middleincome countries the company has partnered with 10 manufacturers around the worldjohnson  johnson whose vaccine is being tested as a single dose making it another contender in the developing world has pledged up to 500 million shots to lowincome countries without specifying which nations would get themchina which has the thirdbiggest vaccine manufacturing capacity in the world has indicated that it intends to make its vaccines available to developing countries last week the united arab emirates issued the first government approval of sinopharm citing preliminary data showing that it was 86 percent effectiveto address vaccine inequity the world health organization and two nonprofits supported by bill gates launched an effort to secure a billion doses for 92 poor countries a billion more would go to dozens of middle and highincome nationssimilar to the us government s investment but on a much smaller scale the effort known as covax has backed the development and manufacturing of vaccine candidates including those of astrazeneca and novavax in return those two companies have promised covax hundreds of millions of dosesbut the initiative has struggled to raise enough money to meet its target even if it did a billion doses would be enough for

classifications by world bankby the new york timesthough wealthy nations have reserved a vast number of vaccines they have to wait in line to get their orders fulfilled manufacturers will need time to ramp up production after getting regulatory approval and countries will not receive all their doses at once just because you ve purchased 100 million doses doesn t mean you ll get 100 million doses in december  said kendall hoyt an assistant professor of medicine at dartmouth who has studied the global rollout of vaccinesin their contracts companies have promised various time frames some public announcements specify that doses will arrive in early 2021 while others are more vague indicating by the end of next year and because the contracts are private it has been hard for governments   and the public   to set realistic expectationsjulia barnesweise head of the global healthcare innovation alliance accelerator who consults on these agreements said it was  mindboggling  that the global supply of covid19 vaccines depended on how these confidential agreements were negotiatedtake pfizer which has said that it will manufacture 13 billion doses in 2021 the us government bought 100 million then was caught off guard when it was later told that it would have to wait until june to receive an additional 100 million included as an option under its contractand while pfizer s vaccines are already flowing to britain canada and the united states it is unclear when they will arrive in other countries mexico according to an announcement could get its first vaccines any time in the next 12 monthsclemens auer a chief negotiator for the european union said an in an email that its contract with pfizer for 200 million doses came with a  fixed delivery timetable  but that he was keeping the details from the public  details don t matter much  he said given the high volume of promising vaccines the eu had securedin canada the government has faced questioning over its contract with moderna the country secured an agreement in august for 20 million doses with an option for an additional 36 million the united states announced a deal for up to 500 million doses shortly after and britain and the european union announced their own deals last monthso when moderna said recently that its first 20 million would go to the united states canadian politicians were accused of letting their country lose its place it wasn t widely known that as a condition for receiving us financial support moderna had promised americans its first dosesin canadian parliament erin o toole the conservative leader introduced a motion requiring the government to post fulfillment dates for its orders saying that citizens  deserve to know when they can expect each vaccine type even if other promising candidates like johnson  johnson s soon get approval and take pressure off pfizer and moderna there s no guarantee the companies will be able to satisfy their commitments next year people think just because we ve demonstrated in phase 3 clinical trials that we have safe and effective vaccines that the spigots are about to be turned completely on  said dr richard hatchett head of the coalition for epidemic preparedness one of the global nonprofits leading the covax program with the who  the challenges of scaling up manufacturing are significant and they are fraught some companies have already revised their projections based on manufacturing issues pfizer initially said it would produce 100 million doses by the end of this year only to cut that number in half novavax delayed clinical trials in part because it couldn t make enough dosesin other cases vaccine makers or their partners may have promised more doses than can be produced 321 billion doses of the astrazeneca vaccine have been committed but manufacturing deals are in place for only 286 billion according to airfinity johnson  johnson has pledged 130 billion but secured manufacturing for only 110 billionpfizer s and moderna s commitments are on par with their production abilities but there appears to be little room for growththe companies  commitments include not just preorders but also expansion deals which may not all come to fruition like the countries the companies are also hedging their betsas stark disparities in vaccine access become more visible there is mounting pressure on wealthy countries to alter their plansaustralia britain canada and the european union have all made financial commitments to covax now they are being encouraged to stagger the delivery of their own doses so the developing world won t be stuck at the end of the line the worst possible outcome is you re offering vaccines to a whole country s population before we re able to offer it to the highestrisk ones in other countries  said dr bruce aylward a senior adviser to the who s directorgeneral who is working on the global vaccine initiativerich countries which may well end up with more doses than they need are also being asked to donate vaccines canada has already begun discussions about how it might do thatso far the united states has been glaringly absent from efforts to address vaccine inequities it has provided no assistance to covax and president trump has promoted vaccine nationalism at every turnbut he signed an executive order this month stating that once the federal government determines there is a sufficient supply for americans it will facilitate international access to its vaccines  for allies partners and others and with presidentelect joseph r biden jr a month from taking office covax officials hope the united states will do more mr biden has already pledged to reverse his predecessor s withdrawal from the whobut even if rich countries donate their excess vaccines the rest of the world will not have all the doses it needs by the end of next yearsome experts predict it will be 2024 before there is enough vaccine others like dr hatchett think that as more people get sick and acquire natural immunity the need for the vaccine will diminish and the supply will be adequate by late 2022either way many more people will die along the wayand if it turns out this is a vaccine that is required every year like the flu shot that will change the projections entirely said dr krishna udayakumar director of the duke global health innovation center then all bets are off  he saidadvertisement

this year began like any other year on the dartmouth campus where students gathered to study compete perform play and then of course many things changed as the pandemic took holddartmouth news takes a look back on an academic year that included a snowy winter carnival and a presidential campaign and by june an introduction to covidrelated changes physical distancing mandatory maskwearing and online and remote teaching and learning among many other thingswhile we may not know exactly what lies ahead we can appreciate the beauty of the upper valley and the success and resilience of the dartmouth community during a unique year through the lenses of college photographer eli burakian 00 multimedia manager robert gill and photo intern keoni ocalvey 20 thayer 21 who talk about some of the details and inspiration behind their favorite photos in calendar order from this past yearjanuary dartmouth s extended upper valley community is always something i love to see these diehard young fans mean a lot to our athletes   robert gilljanuary the winter of 2019 20 was a low snow year but even so we did get a few small storms during the term i like this shot because the snow provides layering within the image while the blur and various foot positions suggest a sense of action probably students moving between classes the snow also gives a painterly quality i believe in the old adage bad weather makes for good photos   eli burakian 00january the quiet strength of the quotidian things don t have to be action packed or amazing to be perfect poignant and beautiful pictured camille landon  21 lauren ross  23 zoe danton  22 in collis   robert gillfebruary there is so much more to the college athletic experience than competition i love watching teams come together and how these students grow in a supportive environment during the winter carnival women s basketball game against yale a cadre of alumni basketball players were honored at halftime here kim selmore  83 shares her appreciation with the dartmouth cheer team which is a coed club sport   eli burakian 00february mayor pete buttigieg was very generous with his time when he came to campus and the students were very excited to meet him dartmouth is transformed into a political hot spot in the years leading up to elections   robert gillfebruary one of the most popular dartmouth traditions is the winter carnival this past year was the first time in many years that dartmouth did not get to have its own winter carnival ski race however students on campus still got to participate in many activities including this bigfoot snowshoe race on the green and this year the weather really cooperated   eli burakian 00february the opening of each new or newly renovated building on campus brings new photographic opportunities using this new architectural element in anonymous hall was a nobrainer   robert gillfebruary the department of theaters winter mainstage production the sweet science of bruising which opened feb 21 gave audiences a ringside view of the challenges that faced women boxers in 19thcentury england the production which follows the lives of four women from different backgrounds as they discover independence through boxing is the american debut of the critically acclaimed 2018 work by british playwright joy wilkinson here playing a couple in the play brooke bazarian  20 and paul west the fight choreographer box in a match i love the action lighting framing of the two people under the punch and the contrast of a dress and a boxing match i love shooting the dress rehearsals of the theater department s mainstage productions as i get to move all around to get the best angles i really miss shooting theater during the pandemic and can t wait until there is another inperson mainstage production   eli burakian 00march phd chemistry student and graduate teaching assistant leah lowder left and mathes vaughan 22 making science fun and accessible as they do   robert gillmarch this aerial abstraction looks more like a de stijl painting than a photograph i m always looking to show the familiar in unfamiliar ways so we can see the places we know so well with fresh eyes and not take them for granted   robert gillapril this was one of my favorite assignments during the pandemic the nh national guard turned alumni gym into an emergency overflow for the hospital luckily the space was not needed as our area quickly organized social distancing efforts   robert gillmay organic farm manager laura braasch right and employee molly mcbride 14 were my mvps this year if ever i was down a trip to the farm was usually the cure they are truly kind and wonderful friends to have they both deserve a great amount of credit for keeping the o farm running donating most of the food produced to those in need   robert gilljune in a year where everything was upside down this reflection seemed to make sense photographing reflections is always a fun challenge my lens was basically touching the water to get this effect it was a relatively small puddle   robert gilljuly i love the thoughtful careful execution necessary to be successful in astrophotography this summer we had the chance to witness the comet neowise which on a clear moonless night shone brilliantly in the western sky given the light pollution in town i went to the organic farm where it was much more visible the light on the barn actually comes from a passing car and provided just the highlight necessary to complete the image   eli burakian 00september although the pandemic has changed my job dramatically it has also created an opportunity to capture this unique moment in history it is only during this time for example that we have masked students standing in line here for their covid tests exactly six feet apart   eli burakian 00september the first day that students were allowed to reenter the library was a special one having the space occupied gave a taste of normalcy and no one was taking it for granted   robert gilloctober although the homecoming festivities were canceled this year due to the pandemic dartmouth made sure the class of 2024 was able to participate in the homecoming tradition of signing and drawing on plywood boards that will be attached to the side of the bonfire structure during next year s celebration here fatima aliamer  24 signs a board on the steps of dartmouth hall   eli burakian 00october keoni ocalvey  20 thayer  21 is one of our photography interns who this fall captured some beautiful shots of campus this photograph shows one student finding his way to get out during the pandemic there has been less traffic on the local roads and more inline skaters skateboarders and bikers than i ve ever seen  eli burakian 00october students and alumni are very familiar with dartmouth s two main offcampus properties at mt moosilauke and the second college grant dartmouth also owns other properties including a beautiful parcel of land across the river in nearby corinth vt this provides an amazing opportunity for research in the field dave lutz right is a professor in environmental studies and works with students and other faculty including his friend eben broadbent left an assistant professor from the school of forest resources  conservation at the university of florida who has created an autonomous drone system that gathers data this includes lidar scanning which creates a robust threedimensional representation of the forest the property is home to a big stand of beautiful black ash which could die within the next five years due to the emerald ash borer beetle and offered a unique opportunity to study the effects and remediation strategies of this environmental threat   eli burakian 00october i was impressed by how dartmouth employees were able to adapt student programing during the pandemic it was not lost on anyone how lucky we are to live in this amazing green and rural place where outdoor access is integral to the dartmouth experience   robert gilloctober man i love this place i m always amazed by the quality of very portable drones in the past half dozen years we have used a number of relatively inexpensive drones the quality of the images the useability and the flight time of the current generation are astounding i particularly like this angle as it shows mt ascutney where i live rising in the distance   eli burakian 00october when the water and air are still the connecticut river can take on the appearance of a lake here from the vermont side is an almost perfect reflection of the trees friends of dartmouth rowing boathouse and ledyard canoe club boathouse dartmouth s location on the river provides many opportunities for students to get out on the water   eli burakian 00october this was my favorite aerial photo of the year the fall leaves in the connecticut river look like stars as this vessel travels through space   robert gillnovember for much of 2020 the front access to dartmouth librarys bakerberry library was closed for repairs when work was nearing completion a beautiful new lawn was laid down and i happened to catch it right as it was about half finished   eli burakian

the associate professor is part of a new consortium of black theater organizations associate professor of theater monica ndounou speaks at the 2018 international black theater summit at dartmouth photo by eli burakian 00monica ndounou an associate professor of theater and the founding executive director of the massachusettsbased the craft institute has a vision of theater by for and about black peoplei would love to see a thriving black theater in every american city and throughout the world a healthy ecosystem that allows black people in particular to thrive in their careers as artists entertainers and producers says ndounou who has taught in the department of theater since 2017that dream is one step closer to fruition with the creation of the black seed initiative a firstofitskind consortium of blackled theater organizations spearheaded by brooklyns billie holiday theater and including ndounous craft institute which provides workshops mentorship and other programming to black theater artists detroits plowshares theatre company and los angeles waco theater centerblack seed recently received 5 million from the andrew w mellon foundation the largestever onetime investment in black theater according to the new york times the gift will among other things allow black seed to administer up to 50 grants to blackled theaters in predominantly black communities around the countrythree of the four theater institutions that make up black seeds national advisory committee attended the craft institutes 2018 international black theatre summit ibts at dartmouth an event celebrating 1998 summit of african american theater leaders convened by montgomery fellow and pulitzer prizewinning playwright august wilsonthe ongoing impact of the summit and craft continues on campus through courses like the making of 21st century exhibits curating a national black theatre museum a dartmouth center for the advancement of learningfunded course designed and taught by ndounou in spring 2019 as part of a collaboration with ibts executive committee member ekundayo bandele founder and ceo of hattiloo theatre who conceived and developed the national black theatre museum project in memphis tenn a third summit originally scheduled for this september was postponed due to the covid19 pandemic but will take place virtually in january 2021through the architecture of what has emerged as the black seed we are collectively taking up the mantel of our ancestors and communities we are part of a continuum of struggle and progress ndounou sayswe started this process long before covid but once covid hit we really started thinking about what the impact was going to be on black theaters particularly considering the disproportionate impact covid has had on black communities the converging pandemics really of covid and racial injusticethe collective nature of black seed is an important part of its mission ndounou says africanbased cultural traditions are grounded in community and collectiveness even ones concept of self includes the ancestors family and community and the yet unborn in a western society that constantly tells you youre by yourself and your life has no value you can feel powerless but when we can embrace the roots of our culture and surmount the barriers that try to prevent us from doing so thats where our power liesndounou says the infrastructure and representation black seed will provide for black theater artists would have been gamechanging for her own early career as a stage actor and directorpart of me feels like i would have accomplished so much more earlier in my life if there were certain battles i didnt have to fight in order to even be in a space that embraced me as an artist i tell my students i want you to graduate with your head high marching out into the world with pride and direction and going right into the field if thats what you want that doesnt mean its going to be easy all the time but i would love for the barriers to be removedndounou believes the dartmouth community can work together to eliminate the barriers that exist on campus outlined in the july 14 open letter from black faculty staff and students to senior leadership she hopes the black seed and black theater in general inspires new pathway for the changeblack theater matters because it creates a space for us as black people to be able to tell our stories about who we are to one another ndounou says were able to tell the truth about who we are to ourselves and to share that story with the larger world the universal aspects of who we are as human beingsto paraphrase playwright lorraine hansberry its through the specific that we reach the universal and black theaters provide that space of cultural specificity of telling our stories on stage that allows us to communicate who we are as human beings to the world so the world can see itself in ushannah silverstein can be reached at hannahsilversteindartmouthedu

factor in my decision to apply so in honor of week 7 i hope this blog post can virtually illustrate some of what dartmouth has to offer in seven images   worth 7000 wordsover the past year ive talked a lot with prospective students picking a college is a big deal but if i knew what i do now id still pick dartmouth a dozen times over recently ive had the pleasure of talking to a few prospective students through dartmouth admissions after sharing my experiences and fielding questions on virtual panels and high school visits im reminded of my own college processfrom writing essays to preparing for interviews while taking classes it may seem like youre drowning in work despite all this i learned a lot from my application process

jump to navigationzombies are big news at the moment but do you know how it all started read this to find out about where zombie mania comes fromdo the preparation exercise first then read the text and do the other exerciseszombies are everywhere these days   on television in movies and in books the current image of the terrifying flesheating zombie comes from george romero s 1968 classic film night of the living dead nowadays many people like to frighten themselves with the idea of the  zombie apocalypse  and enjoy learning how to destroy zombies by decapitation or shooting them in the headhowever zombies are not new the term from the kongo word nzambi which means  spirit of a dead person  has been long associated with the vodou religion of haiti popularly known as voodoo as with west african vodun from which it is descended vodou has strong ties to the supernatural and magic practised by witch doctors called bokorsin haitian culture zombies are not evil creatures but victims they are said to be people who have been killed by poisoning then reanimated and controlled by bokors with magic potions for some specific purpose usually to work as slave labour the bokors were widely feared and respected it is said that they used to be in the service of the secret police and those who defied the authorities were threatened with being turned into the living deadfor a long time most people assumed that zombies were nothing more than mythical figures like werewolves and vampires however this changed in the 1980s when a man called clairvius narcisse claimed that he had been turned into a zombie by means of drugs and forced to work on a sugar plantation for two years before escaping wade davis a harvard scientist investigated the claim and obtained something called  zombie powder  from haitian bokors the main active ingredient was a neurotoxin found in puffer fish which could be used to simulate death the bokors also explained to davis that a second poison made from the datura plant known as the zombie cucumber was given to victims after they were revived from their deathlike state this kept the  zombies  in a submissive state so that it was easy to force them to work davis wrote several books on the topic including the serpent and the rainbow later made into a horror film by director wes cravenalthough the book was very popular with the public some scientists were sceptical of davis s claims they said the amounts of toxin in the powder samples he found were inconsistent and not high enough to produce zombifying effects although many people in haiti still believe in zombies there have been no publicised cases in the last few decades and davis s theory remains controversial the zombie apocalypse seems unlikely to take place soonare you a zombie fan why do you think people like frightening themselves with zombies so much       3x          15x     jenny201 3 december 2020  1015 i dont like zombies but im keen on watching these fictional movies people like to frighten themselves with zombies so much is because of some reasons when they imagine being in these situations they feel scared to face death and lose their family and friends  the end of the world watching zombie movies makes audiences feel more and more authentic every scene and every detail give an impetus to the fear level of human they cant stop thinking about the existence and devastation of zombies as a result thinking too much about it makes them frighten themselves       11x          44x     vuquan 24 august 2020  1515 i am a fan of zombie because they look cool i think ghost or zombie not alive so i dont scare of them people scare of them because they just thinking too much about them so they can be obsess them       1x          1x     enana 9 august 2020  0326 im not a fan of zombies but i do like thembecause when the people  see a movie one impersonates in their place and feels all that adrenaline that is happening in the movie also because they imagine a life without their family and friends only with an apocalypse that they have to deal with until it happens and survive its the main thing       0x          3x     fyawaii217 10 june 2020

about zombies because it is quite challenging but if it is in the real world i am also afraid       0x          3x     andianugrahsar 10 june 2020  0655 in my opinion zombie is an islamic hero from brazil who opposed slavery policies in 1550 adhowever in historical records the name of the islamic warrior is zumbi dos palmaresmaybe it has nothing to do with it but every time i hear the word zombie i am immediately drawn to the name of the brazilian warrior       151x          117x     giovannichoi 10 april 2020  1051 i hate zombies i really love the other monsters like vampire or werewolves but i feel something is wrigglng in my clothes and chill is running down on the spine when i see zombie and heard about z of zombies so when my uncle shows me the walking dead and world war z i used to kick him and escape from him and my uncle shows me that at dawn i cant sleep well at least 7 days i hate them i cant understand why people like zombies and i think people like to frighten themselves by watching zombies because eating peoples flesh bite people and tear people is very very very violent and can make people who watch them blow their stress i will never play zombie games and zombie films even in the future       68x          104x     elife 21 february 2020  1644 really im not a zombie fan but i like some scary movies i think people like frightening themselves with zombies so much because they are curious and like to feel the adrenaline       0x          1x     yiyii69 25 february 2020  1756 i really like zombies but they kinda scare me a bit i think thats why a lot of people like them the feeling of being scared its just addicting       0x          0x     lorretta 1 october 2019  1502 im absolutely not a zombie fan i think they are disgusting and terrible imagining when your country is full of walking corpses people have no where to live and no where to hide day by daythey live in fear and dont even know when they die thats creepy       0x          0x     gean123 27 august 2019  1548 yes im a great fan of zombies i think that people like zombie movies because we like to imagine the situation we are terrified to think of a humanity in an apocalypse our lives without our family and friends the films of zombies are just great the better examples  war world z in this film show us a  scientist that look for the cure for this virus thus facing problems also  other great example is the serie  the walking dead this serie it shows us the problems that this group of people suffer the thing what sets this series apart from the others is that it focuses more on the evolution of the characters and does not focus on zombies as the main antagonist       0x          0x     maribelmc 27 august 2019  1448 i found this text interesting because i consider that i like films that are related to zombies in addition some people get scared of zombies because theyre living dead i always imagined if some moment i saw a zombie would be something traumatic more than anything i would be afraid if it was night the movie that most caught my attention is zombie station because people fight for their lives is or virus that spreads and is difficult to disappear the most beautiful thing is that his father saves his daughter these zombie movies are charming       0x          0x     alexiscontreras 27 august 2019  1406 im not a zombie fan because zombies are very ugly and disgusting however what i like about them is their history and how they are interpreted by diferent cultures i believe that they want to feel something out of the ordinary and in such a way get an adrenaline kick some people may feel too little excitement in their comfortable lives this is their way of filling that gap       1x          0x     arielthein 22 june 2019  0903 i dont understand why people like to frighten others with zombies i mean who knows they could be real researchers are still not sure i think people should also think about myths zombies and all that along with science       0x          0x     parsasoroori 10 april 2019  1858 no im not a zombie fan i enjoy sciencefiction movies but movies about zombies couldnt be true how a composing body can

think theyre terrifying and a little disgusting although i like horror films about spirits and demons i dont really understand why people like these frightening creatures but each one has his opinion and preferences       57290x          1055x     hadia 28 march 2016  0749 yyicksssssim really scared of these creatureswell i doubt if they really exist i think these are our imagination and weaknessesi remembered the time when i was a kid me and my elder sister plus elder brother were watching scoobydoobydoo  it really seemed to be a very horrible cartoonit usually made me frightened but was really thrilling toothat night the name of episode was scoobydoobydoo and the zombies of zambiahuh that was really really very scaryand i even started to believe that zambia is the country of zombies 0 ha ha hathe scoobys team went to zambia and they met a family living in a mansion then afterwards they came to know that all of them were zombiesevery person over there in that country was  a zombie ha ha ha but now if i watch the same cartoon again i dont found it thrilling i laugh at my own thoughts  thats really funny not thrilling ha ha ha        5741x          55x     youaretheonlyone29 27 march 2016  1452 oh i think they are the real product of peoples imagination i cant love them at all although i a huge fan of horror movies  im just interested in ghosts or strange things that we can not explain btw the picture up there is dreadful        2682x          30x     aldair10 6 march 2016  1705 amazing       492x          5x     supita1995 2 february 2016  1057 i am a fan of horror movies but my favourites are more about demons and possessions and not so much zombies and gore       281x          3x     amehsiri 23 november 2015  1655 no i am not a zombie fan at all i find them disgusting terrifying and i have never understood the hype about them although i am not a horror fan at all so that could be one reason but they dont really bring an interesting story to the table like vampires and werewolf s dowhy i think people like to scare themselves with zombies is because it gives you some sort of adrenalin that makes you want more even though you are shaking from fear theres something exciting about the unknown that we need to find out because we as a human race are very curious       63930x          885x     ken 24 november 2015  1235 hmm  a good point but simply it seems to me that a horror fan sounds like an adrenaline addict  or a person who is bored of doing the same thing in everyday life use adrenaline properly            294x          3x     atree 15 november 2015  1631 im not a zombie fan at all i concider them among the most boring horror creatures in existence with very little depth to them i think that the reason that zombies are seen as so frightening is because they picture loss of control the prospect of losing control of yourself and your body is horrifying along with the prospect of death eternal nonexistance as well as the general disgust for cannibalism zombies being reanimated human corpses feeding of human flesh i think people frighten themselves for the same reasons people practice extreme sports for the adrenaline rush for the feeling of being alive and in the moment       279x          3x     00joh03 12 november 2015  1044 i am a fan of zombies or at least works of fiction containing them i think that many people imagine being in a zombie apocalypse because in a zombie apocalypse they would have complete freedom       964x          8x     gustafben 10 november 2015  0921 i myself see no problem in wanting too feel a little frightened sometimes to spice up your normal and boring life sometimes i myself like the concept of zombies and find them entertaining from time to time       293x          3x     00kaj03 9 november 2015  0023 i am not a fan of zombies in fact i find them rather terrifying despite that i understand why some people like the thought of them andor enjoy frightening themselves with them after all humans have always been curious about things they dont understand and isnt that exactly what supernatural things such as zombies are besides frightening oneself often results in an adrenaline rush and that itself might be considered worth the fright by some people       267x          4x     smil73 8 november 2015  2156 i have to say i m only partly a zombie fan considering that i have either enjoyed or loved to watch movies were the zombies were crucial and formerly the main theme but if i was to choose between zombies and vampires well then sorry zombies i choose vampires i myself don t get frightened nor shaken very easy or even at all so my reason is that i simply find it interesting to see how little scared i become but for others i think it might be because most people like to get a tiny rush to shake up their everyday boring life and usually these people have a very excellent imagination and this makes it relatively easier for them to get frightened and with it this tiny rush       63930x          885x     ken 19 november 2015  1235 hi smil73 zombies or vampireswow its hard for me to make a choice between teo extremes isnt it well  i would rather see cookie monster sesame street  and to get a tiny rush to shake up their everyday boring lifeits hard for me to imagine a boring life so i dont need a zombie at

the pair batted all of the fourth day and 12 overs on the fifth before weather intervened to give sri lanka a draw that didnt look possible at 13 for 3scorer chandan duorah  commentator akshay gopalakrishnan356pm play has been officially called off test drawn what a turnaround it has been in the end sri lanka were helped by the rain on the last day but nothing can take away from the stellar effort of mathews and mendis which played a huge part in hanging onto a draw nevermind how the surface played after having spent as much time as they did at the crease and then being three down it needed a herculean effort for them to make something of this test and they got that from mathews and mendisbut dont forget the splendid innings of tom latham who put together a magnum opus  264 unbeaten runs carrying his bat through the new zealand innings it was a clinic in test match batting  embodying all the attributes that make a test innings what it is patience early on seeing off the new ball superb judgment outside off and then once the attack wore down he began picking up pace for that he is the man of the match it was nice to be able to spend time in the middle he says well get a couple of days off we will reenergise and then reassess and regroupwe showed a lot of character throughout the five days says dinesh chandimal it was not an easy task going out and batting angelo has done really well in the last fourfive games everytime he goes to bat we want some runs from him and he has done really well even in the first innings where he and karunaratne put on a stand and in the second innings where he and mendis played superbly we got two young fast bowlers in this game and only suranga has the experience well have to learn a lot from this test we will look forward to executing that in the next testthe forecast wasnt too good says williamson wouldve been good to pick up a few wickets yesterday but sri lanka were at their best well have positives to take from the match certainly the effort was there we certainly expected more pace and bounce from the wicket but it is what it is it was very patient and disciplined batting from sri lanka it just wasnt to be its a shame the weather turned out the way he did but at the same time credit to sri lanka for the character they showed its important we show the same discipline we showed with bat and ball in the first inningsright then that will be a wrap of this test its a shame we couldnt get in more play today but in the little that we did mathews and mendis soldiered on further consolidating their epic stand several highlights from this test which will go down as a memorable one  latham mendismathews the flatness of the wellington surface to name a few who knows what more will be in store in christchurch join us then for now its goodbye from myself and shashank thank you for joining us and all your commentsneeraj absolutely epic mendis and mathews first time its happened outside the subcontinentpranay what a fightback from sri lanka though draw is frustrating it is welldeserved it didnt end in draw because of rain but because mathews and mendis played all day yesterday340pm the blackcaps twitter says that the covers still on and that the umpires and captains will meet at 4pm to assess conditions328pm andrew fernando tells me that theres no change in wellington still a heavy drizzle and it could all be called off at 4pm thats not confirmed as of yet thoughtim implores come on this is getting silly just declare a very very very very frustrating draw already 245pm the rain is light but it is unfortunately persistent which means more waiting but weve had plenty happen around the cricket world over the past 24 hours india collapsed to lose the perth test to australia by 146 runs but even as the indian players sought to shake off the pain of the defeat several others back home started new chapters it was ipl auction day a total of inr 1068000000 was spent in jaipur and  this is how the teams fared at the endfaisal kamal hey akshay looking at numbers from rajesh cant understand the 4th row that says karthikjafferdravidsachin 326 runs   both wasim jaffer and dinesk karthik retired ill on the opening day because of the dhaka heat sachin tendulkar and rahul dravid then batted out the remaining overs as india finished on 326 for no loss karthik later returned to bat on the second day and was eventually caught at midwicketyasas sl ipl auction 2019 is all done or is there a another round today   its done speaking of which this years auction was all about the young uns there were mystery spinners some overseas sensations and indian fast bowlers but the overriding theme was youth who became millionaires whose lives changed forever who were the overseas hits and who endured disappointment alagappan muthu captures it beautifully in his wrap of the event 2pm were back live and unfortunately the rain is steady and persistent the covers are firmly on as we wait on remember around now is when the worst of the rains were forecast to hit wellington not looking so great at the moment im afraidfor the little play that has been possible today mathews and mendis have soldiered on they also collected an assortment of records yesterday during the course of their alliance s rajesh our stats editor brings you the numbersjonathan waking up to seeing this partnership still flourishing puts a smile on my face  sucks that the rain is cutting it shortali wazir with developments and modernisation in our great sport such as the introduction of daynight tests drs free hits and 2 new balls in odis isnt it time for the powers that be to come up with a solution to counter the rain especially in tests a full days play today would more likely than not yield a result now its heading towards a draw124pm  spots of rain seen on the tv lens the umpires converge and theyve decided to walk off for lunch with seven minutes still remaining in the session im afraid this is going to be the flavour of the day mathews and mendis continue to soldier onmeanwhile trent boult to boundary photographer are you running out of things to take photos ofds to add to gryllus sentiment we also have two back to back odi games two days apart at the bay oval but the only cricket auckland gets is two t20 games why would you bother gryllus so test match number one of the season ruined by a flat pitch we get just one more then a seemingly endless series of stupid limited over games before 3 more tests against bangladesh in march when autumn is starting to close in jesus wept  why bother with cricket at allsilly point in placekane williamsons team tried everything but sri lankas batsmen were just too goodusually an unrepentant strokemaker sri lankas no 4 overturned his batting style to block his way to an outstanding matchsaving hundredgesture possibly directed towards head coach who left him out of the limitedovers setup on fitness groundsfor the first time in more than ten years no wicket fell in an entire day of test cricketsri lanka batting coach thilan samaraweera will exit the role at the end of this series and kusal mendis is keen on fulfilling his wish
